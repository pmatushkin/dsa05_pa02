# Data Structures and Algorithms
## Advanced Algorithms And Complexity Programming Assignment 02: Linear Programming
### Problems
Practice reducing real-world problems to linear programming and implementing algorithms to solve them:
* [`/src/energy_values/EnergyValues.java`](src/energy_values/EnergyValues.java): Problem 1, Infer Energy Values of Ingredients, applies Gaussian Elimination to infer the energy values of ingredients given a restaurant menu with calorie counts and ingredient lists provided for each item;
* [`/src/diet/Diet.java`](src/diet/Diet.java): Problem 2, Optimal Diet Problem, implements an algorithm for solving linear programming with only a few inequalities and applies it to determine the optimal diet;
* [`/src/ad_allocation/AdAllocation.java`](src/ad_allocation/AdAllocation.java): Advanced Problem 3, Online Advertisement Allocation, helps an online advertising system like Google AdSense or Yandex Direct to allocate the ad impressions in its Advertising Network so as to maximize revenue while satisfying all the advertisersâ€™ requirements.
